        I’ve always known that I wanted to compose music that speaks to people.
        I write for both large and small ensembles, for the stage and the
        screen. My compositions are designed to inspire and connect with anyone
        who listens to them. I’m passionate about breaking boundaries and making
        classical music more accessible to people through media scoring,
        imaginative concert experiences, and collaboration with artists in and
        outside of music. Although I specialize in classical, I’m interested in
        all kinds of music, and I use that curiosity to push myself to create
        something new and unique that will resonate with audiences around the
        world.

        ECHO has been a joy and privilege to work on, especially with this team
        of amazing and kind-hearted individuals. I never imagined having the
        opportunity to write music (backed by science!) to create healthier
        communities! I hope everyone enjoys exploring their hearts in Echoville
        as much as I’ve enjoyed imagining how it sounds :) &nbsp;-Bella Rose
